Big Thanks to:
Scripter: Vynixus, Kieran!

How to use the program:
First of all, you need to log into rblxwild and roblox.
Second of all, again, you need to have python installed.
And third, run the .exe file, and type the Game hash.
For example (8a622c712daa62bc830f0456ff94c7c822710efcdd06a7e85c3d966d6ea003871093ff81054832f16fbad532ef261eb0c88f5453fdd2be4fbfd9ba167ff79a4d)
And then, it should say at when it crashes! 

Have a nice day!
Thanks for using our program!
